## Work Experience
### 12/09/2023 - Current 
- I am a data analyst at Lloyds Banking Group (LBG). I work within the Secured Mortgages Impairment team in the Risk Science division, where we report on expected credit losses (ECL) that the bank will incur from mortgages. These losses usually arise from missed payments which can lead to further losses when the bank may need to repossess a property. We will delve into the many factors behind why we may see increases or decreases in ECL such as economic conditions or changes to interest rates etc.
