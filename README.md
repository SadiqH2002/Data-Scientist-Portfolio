## About Me
I enjoy playing padel as it is really fun, competitive and helps keep me active! I am also a big fan of football and try to keep up to date with it as much as I can! I aim to pursue a career in data analytics and modelling. Climbing the corporate ladder and exploring the world whilst doing so is an objective and dream of mine that I will achieve through gaining more experience. This profile will be a great way for me to showcase my projects and show progression over time in my projects!

## Education
### Apprenticeships:
    - Level 4 Data Analyst (HNC) (Completed: March 2025)
    - Level 6 Data Scientist (TBC: November 2027)

## Work Experience
### 12/09/2023 - Current 
- I am a data analyst at Lloyds Banking Group (LBG). I work within the Secured Mortgages Impairment team in the Risk Science division, where we report on expected credit losses (ECL) that the bank will incur from mortgages. These losses usually arise from missed payments which can lead to further losses when the bank may need to repossess a property. We will delve into the many factors behind why we may see increases or decreases in ECL such as economic conditions or changes to interest rates etc.
